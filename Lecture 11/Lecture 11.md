## Spam and Security
- Unwanted email is a major problem
	- was over 90% of received emails in 1990s
- Countermeasures:
	- DomainKey Identified Mail(DKIM): Only registered IP addresses can send for a domain
	- Realtime Blackhole Lists: Automatic updates based on seen or suspected bad behaviour
	- Spam filteing:Bayesians filters based on content at ISP,email server, or local level
- STARTTLS: Include encryption on SMTP sessions 
	-  Most email servers today require encryption 
	-  Encryption is not the same as authentication (!)


	IMAP, POP and SMTP are different protocols used for email communication. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a protocol for retrieving email messages from a mail server. It allows you to store your emails on the server and access them from multiple devices. POP (Post Office Protocol) is an older protocol used for retrieving email messages. It downloads emails to your local device and typically deletes them from the server. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for sending email messages from one server to another. It's what's used to send emails from your mail client to a mail server, and then from the mail server to the recipient's mail server.
