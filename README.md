# Advanced Networking Course Summary
This document provides a summary of the key topics covered in the Advanced Networking course. The course covers advanced concepts and technologies in computer networking, including routing protocols, network security, and network design.

## Routing Protocols
- Distance-vector routing protocols: These protocols use information about the distance to a destination network to determine the best path. Examples include Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP).
- Link-state routing protocols: These protocols use information about the state of the network links to determine the best path. Examples include Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS).
- Hybrid routing protocols: These protocols combine features from both distance-vector and link-state protocols to achieve improved performance and stability. Examples include Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).


1.  Transport layer issues: transport layer protocols (TCP, UDP) and their behavior, intra-network and inter-network routing, MPLS, congestion control and avoidance, multicast, IPv6, resource reservation
2.  Application layer protocols: WWW, HTTP, web servers
3.  Alternative network architectures: cellular networks, fixed infrastructure networks

Protocols for the above topics will be discussed along with their properties and ways to improve them.

Protocols considered in the course include:

-   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
-   User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
-   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
-   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
-   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
-   IP version 6 (IPv6)
-   802.11 Wireless Networks (abgn)
-   UMTS
-   GSM
