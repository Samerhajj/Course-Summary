# Advanced Networking Course Summary
This document provides a summary of the key topics covered in the Advanced Networking course. The course covers advanced concepts and technologies in computer networking, including routing protocols, network security, and network design.

## Routing Protocols
- Distance-vector routing protocols: These protocols use information about the distance to a destination network to determine the best path. Examples include Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP).
- Link-state routing protocols: These protocols use information about the state of the network links to determine the best path. Examples include Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS).
- Hybrid routing protocols: These protocols combine features from both distance-vector and link-state protocols to achieve improved performance and stability. Examples include Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).
